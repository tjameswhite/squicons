# squicons - Icons for Favicon Testing

Favicons in 25 sizes, literally named so you can see which get applied.

Trying to figure out exactly which sizes of favicons are needed is a confusing mass of information. While most sites list every size and note which ones are outdated, there is little consensious about what the subset of sizes should be. In order to find out for myself what sizes get used, I created 25 crude numerically named icons for easy identification.

## <abbr title="Too long, didn't read">TL/DR</abbr>

You only need 2 favicons: 32px, 180px.
